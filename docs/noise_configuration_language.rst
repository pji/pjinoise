Noise Configuration Language
============================

This document describes the syntax used to configure individual noise 
objects from the command line. When implemented, this will allow the 
use of multiple types of noise to be used in the creation of images 
without having to manually write a configuration file. Whether this is 
easier than creating the config file is an open question.
